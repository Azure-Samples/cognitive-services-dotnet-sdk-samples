## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2017. If required, you can download free community version from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/.
- A cognitive services API key is required to authenticate SDK calls. [Create a new Azure account, and try Cognitive Services for free.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/) **Alternately**, for a production scenario, you can buy an access key from here: https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingSearch-v7. While buying an access key, you may want to consider which tier is appropriate for you. More information is [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/search-api/web/). 
- .NET core SDK (ability to run .netcore 1.1 apps). You can get CORE, Framework, and Runtime from here: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/. 
- You will need Custom Config ID, if you are running the Bing Custom Search sample. You can get this from customsearch.ai by creating your own custom search instance. Here is a step-by-step guide to create a custom search instance: https://blogs.bing.com/search-quality-insights/2017-12/build-your-ads-free-search-engine-with-bing-custom-search.

### Quickstart

To get the Bing Search sample running locally, follow these steps:

1. git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples.git
2. Open cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples\BingSearchv7\BingAllSearch\bing-search-dotnet.sln from Visual Studio 2017
3. You need not install individual packages as they are contained in the tempPackage folder. If these don't work you can get the latest by: npm install <packages as mentioned above in Features section> from Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console. **Alternately**, you can go to Project > Manage Nuget Packages and search for individual packages in the "Browse" tab, and click on "Install". 
4. Click on "bing-search-dotnet" for debug/release version from the top of Visual Studio. **Alternately** you can build and run solution in separate steps.
