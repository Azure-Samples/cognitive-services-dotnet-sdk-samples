# Bing Search SDK Samples

These samples will show you how to get up and running using the SDKs for various Bing Search services. They'll cover a few rudimentary use cases and hopefully express best practices for interacting with the data from these APIs.

## Features

Please note that this samples package references an all-in-one SDK which includes all Bing Search services. Individual packages exist for each service if you would prefer working with smaller assembly sizes. Both individual service packages as well as the all-in-one will have feature parity for a particular service.

This project framework provides examples for the following services:

* Using the **Bing Entity Serach SDK** \[[individual package](http://linktopackage)\]\[[complete package](http://linktopackage)\] for the [Entity Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-entity-search-api/)
* Using the **Bing Web Search SDK** \[[individual package](http://linktopackage)\]\[[complete package](http://linktopackage)\] for the [Web Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A cognitive services API key with which to authenticate the SDK's calls. [Sign up here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/) by navigating to the **Search** services and acquiring an API key. You can get a trial key for **free** which will expire after 30 days.
- .NET core SDK (ability to run .netcore 1.1 apps)

### Installation

- npm install [package doesnt exist yet](http://linktopackage)
