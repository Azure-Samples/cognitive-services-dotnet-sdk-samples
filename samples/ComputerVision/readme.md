# Sample Solution that uses the Computer Vision SDK

The projects in this code are quickstarts that show how to use Computer Vision SDK for local and remote images

## Contents

| File/folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| AnalyzeImage       | Analyzes image on specified visual parameters |
| DetectObjects | Detects objects in an image |
| BatchReadFile | Looks for printed or handwritten text in a file (accepts PDFs too) |
| OCR | Performs OCR on the image|
| RegionOfInterest | Gets area of interest|
| TagImage | Descriptive tags for an image|
| Describe Image | A caption for the image |
| Recognize Text | Uses RecognizeText for printed and handwritten text | 
| Get Thumbnail | Gets a recommended thumbnail for an image given a target size | 
| ComputerVision.sln | The Visual Studio solution with the above as projects|
| `readme.md` | This README file. |


## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2015](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or higher
- [An Azure Subscription Key](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/?api=computer-vision) 

## Setup

1. Clone or download this sample repository
2. Open the solution ComputerVision_SDK.sln in Visual Studio
3. Download the images from [this repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/blob/master/ComputerVision/Images/) and add the Images folder as content to each project. Alternatively modify the `imageFilePath` in all projects to reflect the path of an appropriate local image.


## Running the samples

1. Right-click on the relavant project (detectObjects, extractText, etc) and click on 'Set as StartUp Project'
2. In 'Program.cs' , update the line ```private const string subscriptionKey = "<your training key here>";``` with your subscription key. For example, if your subscription key is `0123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF`, then the line should look like ```c# private const string subscriptionKey = "0123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF"; ```
3. Update the endpoint with the region you generated your endpoint for. For example, if you are using the westcentralus endpoint, you should change the line ```public const string endpoint = "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"; ``` to  ``` public const string endpoint = "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com"; ```
4. (Optional) Change the remote image URL
5. (Optional) Comment out visual parameters not needed for AnalyzeImage 
6. Hit F5 or build the solution
